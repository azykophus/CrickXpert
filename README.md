This project applies machine learning techniques to predict cricket innings outcomes, utilizing a dataset of IPL matches from 2007-2017, containing over 75,000 entries across 15 features. It evaluates models like Linear Regression (with a Mean Absolute Error of 12.15), Decision Trees, Random Forest (MAE of 13.159), and AdaBoosting, alongside classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and MLP, achieving up to 48% accuracy in event prediction. This numerical approach enhances strategy formulation and real-time decision-making, demonstrating the quantitative impact of data science on cricket analytics.
